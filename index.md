#### **About Me**  

:::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px; "}

::: {}

A PhD Candidate in the [Medical Genetics Graduate Program](https://medgen.med.ubc.ca/) at [The University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca/), I currently reside in the lovely and vibrant city of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada.

My research interests lie in developmental, cardiovascular, and population genetics. My curiosity is driven by wanting to elucidate the genetic differences that exist between populations of different ancestries.  

I firmly believe that the more you give, the more you get, and as such, I try to give back as much as I can to the community.  

I’m an avid bibliophile, coffee enthusiast, and culinary aficionado. I also make and sell custom genetics-themed graphics and merchandise on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/ScribblezbyNiki)!
